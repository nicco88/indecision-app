# Nicco's Indecision App
Learning React Fundamentals while following [Andrew Mead's React Course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/).
You can find the related project on [his Github](https://github.com/andrewjmead/react-course-2-indecision-app).

This project follows the same structure, but I used [brunch.io](http://brunch.io) instead of webpack,
as well as [postcss](http://postcss.org/) instead of sass.
